# Policy Proposal: UK Net Wealth Tax (Excluding Pensions) – A Structured Framework

## Executive Summary

**Context:** Wealth inequality in the UK has reached stark levels – **the richest 1% of Britons now hold more wealth than the bottom 70% of the population**. There is growing public and political momentum to ensure the very wealthiest contribute more. Recent polling shows **78% of Britons support a 2% annual tax on net assets over £10 million** rather than relying on spending cuts. In response, this report proposes a **UK-based net wealth tax focused on assets and investments, explicitly excluding pension savings**. The aim is to raise substantial revenue from the most affluent, **reduce extreme wealth inequality**, and improve fairness, while **protecting pensions** to maintain retirement incentives and public acceptability.

**Proposal in Brief:** A progressive annual wealth tax would apply **above a high net-worth threshold (e.g. £2 million per individual)**, with higher rates on ultra-wealthy fortunes. **All major assets** – real estate, financial investments, business equity, and luxury goods – would be included in the tax base **except pension assets**, which are exempt. Strong anti-avoidance measures (asset reporting, transparency, and international cooperation) will back the tax, minimizing evasion. **Preliminary estimates suggest on the order of £20–25 billion in annual revenue** could be raised, which can fund public services or debt reduction, while primarily affecting fewer than 1% of adults. Administrative implementation, though challenging, is feasible with a phased approach over several years, drawing on HMRC’s existing capabilities. The overall economic impact is expected to be progressive – **reducing wealth concentration at the top and modestly narrowing inequality**, with limited effects on investment given the moderate rates and targeted scope. The following sections detail the policy design and its justification.

---

## 1. Thresholds and Tax Rates

**Progressive Tax Structure:** The wealth tax is designed with **a high entry threshold and graduated rates** to target only the most affluent households. Table 1 outlines the proposed rate schedule:

| **Net Wealth Band (per individual)** | **Marginal Tax Rate** |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| £0 – £2 million                      | 0% (exempt)           |
| **£2 million – £10 million**         | **1.0% annually**     |
| **£10 million and above**            | **2.0% annually**     |

**Threshold Rationale:** An individual’s first £2 million of net wealth would be exempt. Tax would **only apply to wealth above £2 million**, ensuring that **approximately the top 1% of adults** – those with multi-million-pound net worth – are liable. (By contrast, a much lower threshold of £500,000 would affect over 7 million people, which is not the intent of this targeted policy.) Setting the initial threshold at £2 million focuses the tax on those with substantial assets beyond a primary residence and typical pension, thereby **avoiding encumbering the middle class**. For illustration, in 2020 the Wealth Tax Commission found that using a £2 million threshold (including all assets) would cover roughly 626,000 individuals (\~1% of adults).

**Graduated Rates:** Above the threshold, a **1% annual tax** on assets from £2–10 million is proposed, with a top rate of **2% on wealth over £10 million**. This higher rate for ultra-high-net-worth individuals aligns with public calls to ensure the super-rich pay a fair share: a coalition of economists and campaigners recently advocated a 2% rate on wealth over £10 million, which would impact only \~20,000 people (0.04% of the population). Under this proposal, *for example*:

* An individual with **£5 million** net wealth (excluding pensions) would pay 1% on the £3m above the £2m threshold = **£30,000 per year**.
* An individual with **£15 million** net wealth would pay 1% on the £8m in the £2–10m band (£80,000) plus 2% on the £5m above £10m (£100,000), **total £180,000 per year** (an effective rate of 1.2% on their total wealth).

The tax is **structured on a marginal basis**, so that only wealth above each threshold is taxed at the corresponding rate (preventing any “cliff edge” where falling just over a threshold would impose tax on the entire sum). **Couples** would be treated individually by default (each spouse has a £2m allowance), but **joint assets** could be split between spouses for valuation so that a married couple would effectively have a combined £4 million tax-free band. This individual-based assessment aligns with the Wealth Tax Commission’s recommendation for fairness and simplicity, while ensuring couples do not face double taxation on jointly owned assets.

**Periodicity and Inflation Adjustment:** The tax would be assessed **annually** on net wealth as of a valuation date (e.g. 5 April each year, aligning with the tax year). Thresholds would be **indexed to inflation** (e.g. CPI) to prevent fiscal drag from gradually pulling moderately wealthy households into the tax due to nominal growth. Rate adjustments or threshold changes could be reviewed periodically by an independent fiscal body to ensure the tax continues to meet revenue and equity goals without unintended expansion of scope.

## 2. Assets and Investments Covered (Tax Base)

**Broad Base – All Major Assets Included:** The tax base encompasses a **comprehensive measure of net wealth** (assets minus liabilities), capturing a wide range of assets and investment holdings so that wealthy individuals cannot easily shift their wealth into exempt categories. **Included assets** would cover:

* **Real estate property** – *Residential and commercial property* holdings worldwide, including primary residences, second homes, buy-to-let properties, and land. Property values would be based on fair market value (with valuations initially supplied by the UK Valuation Office Agency or equivalent data, subject to taxpayer appeal). Mortgage debt would be deducted to calculate net equity.
* **Financial assets** – *Stocks, shares, bonds, and mutual funds* (including those held in brokerage accounts or investment portfolios), *cash and bank deposits*, and *ownership stakes in private businesses or partnerships*. For privately-held companies, share valuations would be based on company financials or professional appraisal to determine fair market value.
* **Interests in trusts or foundations** – Assets held in trust where the individual is a beneficiary or settlor with retained powers would be attributed to the individual proportionally, closing a common avoidance route (see **Section 3** on avoidance).
* **Other investment assets and valuables** – *Luxury goods, collectibles, and tangible assets* held primarily as investments or stores of value. This includes high-value art collections, antiques, jewellery, yachts, classic cars, precious metals, and similar assets that are commonly part of the asset portfolios of the wealthy. To ease administration, personal use assets of modest value (vehicles, furniture, etc. below a certain individual value threshold, e.g. £50,000) could be excluded. However, **exceptionally valuable personal assets** would be in scope if their value exceeds the de minimis threshold, ensuring that holdings like fine art or rare collectibles cannot escape taxation simply by being classified as personal property.

**Exclusion of Pension Assets:** *All forms of pension wealth are explicitly excluded* from this tax base by design. This means **private pension pots (defined contribution pensions), occupational pensions, and defined benefit pension entitlements** are **not counted as taxable wealth**. The rationale is to **respect the special status of pensions** – savings accumulated for retirement under tax-advantaged schemes and often not accessible until retirement age. Taxing pension wealth would contradict long-standing policy incentives for retirement saving and raise liquidity issues (since pension funds generally cannot be withdrawn early). Public attitude research confirms strong opposition to including pension savings in any wealth tax. By excluding pensions, the proposal avoids penalizing individuals who have diligently saved for retirement and **maintains consistency with the current tax framework** (pensions are taxed upon withdrawal as income). It is acknowledged that **excluding pensions narrows the tax base and forgoes some revenue** – studies indicate that exempting pension wealth could reduce total yield by over **50% at moderate wealth thresholds**. Nevertheless, this exemption is a deliberate policy choice to bolster political and social acceptability, focusing the tax on assets that reflect more discretionary wealth holdings.

**Debate on Main Residence:** Notably, this proposal **does include primary residences** in the tax base (unlike some public preferences to exempt the main home). The main home often constitutes a large share of wealth for middle-wealth households; however, by setting a high £2m threshold, *only very expensive homes* (net of any mortgage) contribute to taxable wealth. Completely excluding the main residence would significantly shrink the base – a analysis found that exempting both pensions and main homes would require dramatically higher tax rates on remaining assets to achieve a given revenue. Including primary housing equity promotes **horizontal equity**: two individuals with equal net worth will be treated similarly even if one’s wealth is tied up in property and another’s in financial investments. To address concerns about liquidity for “asset-rich, cash-poor” individuals (e.g. an elderly person in a high-value house but with low income), **deferred payment options** are proposed (see Section 5 on Administration). This ensures no one is forced to sell their home to pay the tax, while still incorporating substantial housing wealth at the top end into the base for fairness.

**Net Wealth Calculation:** Taxable wealth would be calculated on an **individual’s global assets minus liabilities**. All debt secured against taxable assets (such as mortgages or business loans) would be deductible, so that the tax truly falls on **net** wealth. This mirrors the approach used in other countries with wealth taxes (e.g. Switzerland and Spain) and avoids disincentivizing investment financed by borrowing. Clear **valuation rules** would be established for each asset class (drawing on existing HMRC guidance for market value). Many assets have observable market values (publicly traded securities, real estate with comparable sales, etc.), and for illiquid assets (private businesses, art) professional valuation standards would be applied. The valuation date each year would be fixed (with anti-avoidance measures to prevent artificial depression of values on that date).

By **casting a wide net over asset types** and **allowing few exemptions (with the key exception of pensions)**, this design minimizes the scope for wealthier individuals to convert one form of wealth into another to escape tax. It aligns with the principle that *a pound of wealth should be taxed equally regardless of whether it is held in property, stocks, or gold*. This broad base also permits the tax rates to be kept relatively low (1–2%) while still raising meaningful revenue, as discussed next.

## 3. Enforcement and Anti-Avoidance Measures

A wealth tax’s success hinges on **robust enforcement and closing of loopholes**, given the high incentives for the wealthy to evade or avoid payment. The proposal includes a multi-pronged strategy to ensure compliance and minimize avoidance:

* **Comprehensive Reporting Requirements:** All individuals *above a certain wealth indicator* (for example, those with income above a threshold or known assets above £1m) would be required to file an annual **net wealth statement** with HMRC, declaring all owned assets and liabilities in each category. Financial institutions and asset registries would be leveraged for third-party reporting: banks and investment managers could be required to report year-end account balances for high-net-worth clients, similar to how employment income is reported via PAYE. The recent expansion of automatic exchange of financial information under the OECD Common Reporting Standard means HMRC can obtain data on offshore accounts held by UK residents. These tools make it harder to conceal financial assets abroad.

* **Leveraging Asset Registries and Transparency:** The UK has taken steps to increase transparency of asset ownership, which will aid wealth tax enforcement. For example, the new **Register of Overseas Entities (ROE)** now legally requires that *all overseas entities owning UK property disclose their beneficial owners* to Companies House. This helps prevent wealthy individuals from hiding UK real estate behind shell companies. Similarly, the Persons of Significant Control register records ultimate owners of UK companies. The wealth tax regime would **integrate with these registries**, ensuring that any property or company stake linked to a UK resident is factored into their net wealth. Over time, the government could consider establishing a **central asset registry** for high-value assets (such as artwork or yachts) to further improve transparency. While such a registry would be a large undertaking, it could be done incrementally, perhaps starting with requiring documentation of valuable chattels when insurance appraisals or sales occur.

* **Anti-Avoidance Legislation:** Specific anti-avoidance rules will be enacted to close known loopholes:

  * *Trusts and Foundations:* Assets placed into trust by a UK resident will be treated as still part of the settlor’s taxable wealth if they retain any beneficial enjoyment or powers, unless it’s an irrevocable trust for genuinely independent beneficiaries. Likewise, if a UK resident is a beneficiary of an offshore trust, the assets attributable to their interest would be included in their tax base. This prevents the use of family trusts to sidestep the tax.
  * *Resident Non-Domiciliaries:* Individuals who are UK tax residents, regardless of domicile status, will be subject to the wealth tax on their worldwide assets (with possible credit for wealth taxes paid overseas to avoid double taxation). This removes the incentive for long-term UK residents to shelter assets offshore or invoke non-dom status. Short-term residents (e.g. foreigners in the UK under 2 years) might be excluded or given relief to avoid deterring genuine temporary relocations.
  * *Asset Transfers and Gifting:* To prevent taxpayers from simply transferring wealth to relatives or others below the threshold, **attribution rules** will apply to certain gifts. If an individual gifts away assets but continues to derive benefit from them (e.g. continues living in a gifted house), those assets remain in their tax base. Large gifts made shortly before the valuation date or on a regular annual basis may be scrutinized by HMRC to ensure they are genuine transfers of ownership. While the tax does not directly impose a charge on gifts, existing inheritance tax rules (which treat gifts within 7 years of death as part of the estate) could be complemented by similar look-back provisions for the wealth tax if abuse becomes prevalent.
  * *Corporate Wrappers:* Wealth held through private investment companies or partnerships will be “looked through” so that the underlying assets are taxed as if held directly. Merely moving personal investments into a closely-held company would not reduce liability – the company’s net asset value would be apportioned to the individual shareholder’s wealth. The same applies to assets parked in special purpose vehicles or family investment companies.
  * *Debt and Artificial Losses:* Rules will ensure that only genuine, arms-length debts reduce the taxable base. Artificially taking on loans between related parties, or leveraging assets solely to reduce net wealth on the assessment date, will be disregarded by HMRC if done primarily to avoid tax. Anti-avoidance provisions can empower HMRC to ignore transactions lacking economic substance (similar to the existing General Anti-Abuse Rule).

* **Dedicated Enforcement Unit:** HMRC would establish a **High Net Worth Wealth Tax Unit**, analogous to its existing High Net Worth Unit, staffed with specialists in asset valuation, forensic accounting, and international tax law. This unit will conduct audits and spot checks on wealth tax returns, focusing on complex cases and potential under-reporting. Given the relatively small taxpayer pool (tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals), it is feasible to apply a high level of scrutiny. Penalties for misreporting or evasion would be substantial (e.g. fines a multiple of the tax evaded, and criminal prosecution for deliberate fraud) to deter non-compliance.

* **International Cooperation:** Recognizing the global mobility of capital, the UK would collaborate with other countries to discourage avoidance. This could include **information-sharing agreements** to trace ownership of assets across jurisdictions and advocating for international standards on wealth transparency. In the long run, the UK can support initiatives for a **global asset registry** or harmonized wealth tax rules to mitigate capital flight. In the interim, the UK could consider an “*exit charge*” such that if a taxpayer emigrates and gives up UK tax residency, they are deemed to have disposed of their assets (triggering capital gains taxes) or be subject to a one-time wealth tax assessment on departure. This acts as a disincentive for wealthy individuals to leave the country purely to avoid the tax (similar to the expatriation tax imposed by the US on individuals renouncing citizenship).

**Minimizing Avoidance and Evasion:** These combined measures aim to address the typical failure points that led some countries historically to repeal wealth taxes. In the past, *wealth taxes were often undermined by the wealthy exploiting loopholes or shifting assets abroad*, resulting in lower-than-expected revenues. By learning from those experiences – **broadly including asset classes, closing trust and offshore gaps, and increasing transparency – this proposal seeks to ensure the tax is actually borne by the wealthiest households as intended**. As evidence, modern enforcement tools (like data from the global financial system) can considerably shrink the space for evasion compared to decades past. Still, it is acknowledged that some degree of avoidance will occur; revenue estimates have been adjusted downward (by an avoidance discount, e.g. assuming perhaps 10-15% of potential base is lost to avoidance, consistent with international evidence) in line with observed experiences in countries with wealth taxes. Continuous monitoring will allow the government to tighten rules as needed if new avoidance schemes emerge.

## 4. Revenue Estimates and Fiscal Impact

**Revenue Potential:** A wealth tax of this design would raise a significant sum from a narrow segment of taxpayers. **Estimated annual revenue is on the order of tens of billions of pounds per year**. Based on available data and simplifying assumptions:

* A recent analysis by Oxfam and Tax Justice UK found that a **2% tax on wealth over £10 million could raise approximately £24 billion per year**. That scenario only taxes the ultra-rich (\~20,000 individuals). Our proposal broadens the base by also taxing wealth in the £2–10 million range (at 1%), which encompasses roughly the top 1% of adults (several hundred thousand individuals). This broader base would yield additional revenue in the single-digit billions.

* The Wealth Tax Commission’s research (2020) can be used to triangulate the potential yield. They calculated that a **one-off 5% tax on individual wealth above £2 million would raise about £80 billion** (paid over 5 years). This implies that *in one year, a 1% tax on wealth over £2m could raise roughly £16 billion* (before behavioral responses). However, that £16bn figure included **pension wealth and all assets**. Since our proposal excludes pensions (which can reduce the base substantially), the annual yield might be lower. Offsetting this, we apply a higher 2% rate on >£10m wealth, capturing more from billionaires. Taking these factors together, we estimate **\~£20–25 billion per annum net revenue** as a realistic order-of-magnitude. This would represent a sizeable new revenue stream (for context, £20bn is roughly equivalent to 2-3p on the basic rate of income tax or about 1% of GDP).

* **Distribution of taxpayers:** Approximately **600,000–700,000 individuals** (roughly 1% of the adult population) would have wealth above £2 million and thus fall within the scope of the tax on at least part of their assets. Within this group, a much smaller subset – about **20,000 people with fortunes above £10 million** – would account for a large share of the revenues due to the higher 2% rate on their excess wealth. In effect, the **top 0.1% of UK wealth holders would contribute a majority** of the tax receipts, reflecting the extreme concentration of wealth at the top. This design is highly progressive: those just over the £2m threshold pay a modest amount, while multi-millionaires and billionaires pay substantially more in absolute terms.

* **Revenue usage:** The proceeds from a wealth tax could be allocated in various ways according to policy priorities. For example, \~£20 billion could fund a significant increase in education or NHS spending, bolster social care budgets, or reduce the need for austerity measures. It could also be used to pay down public debt incurred during recent economic crises. Earmarking the revenue for popular public services might further increase public support for the tax. (Notably, public preference strongly favors taxing wealth over cutting services.) In any case, these funds provide the UK government with additional fiscal flexibility to address inequality or invest in long-term growth.

**Administrative Costs:** Implementing a wealth tax will involve non-trivial administrative expenses, especially in initial setup. There will be costs for **valuation systems, additional HMRC staff, new IT infrastructure for wealth reporting, and taxpayer guidance/outreach**. The one-time startup costs (spread over the first few years) could be in the low billions of pounds, and ongoing annual administrative costs in the low hundreds of millions. For perspective, the Wealth Tax Commission estimated administrative costs on the order of **£0.2–0.5 billion per year** for an ongoing wealth tax raising \~£10bn, plus one-off setup costs of perhaps **£0.5–£1 billion**. Scaling to a £20bn revenue, annual admin might be around £0.4–£0.8bn (just a few pence per £1 of revenue). This is relatively high compared to very established taxes, but acceptable given the concentration of the tax base (for comparison, administering income tax costs HMRC roughly 0.7% of revenue). The goal would be to keep **administrative cost well under 5% of revenue**, meaning over 95% of the gross yield is delivered to the Exchequer. Economies of scale and improved data integration (with digital asset valuation tools) can further reduce admin costs over time.

**Uncertainty in Estimates:** It is important to note that actual revenues will depend on market conditions and behavioral responses. **Asset values can fluctuate** (for instance, property or equity market downturns would shrink the tax base in a given year). Moreover, if the very wealthy engage in aggressive avoidance or emigrative behavior despite countermeasures, revenues could be lower than forecast. International evidence shows annual wealth taxes often raise less than initially projected due to such responses. Our estimates build in a prudent avoidance/elasticity adjustment (assuming perhaps 10-15% of potential liability is mitigated by taxpayer behavior). Conversely, if enforcement is very effective and the economy grows, revenue could exceed expectations. The proposed monitoring framework (Section 5) will track the yield and recommend rate or threshold adjustments as needed to meet revenue targets.

In summary, even allowing for uncertainty, a UK wealth tax on non-pension assets **could reliably raise on the order of tens of billions of pounds each year**. This represents a meaningful contribution to public finances, helping diversify the tax base (currently reliant on income, consumption, and property taxes) and directly tapping into the **stock of wealth that has grown markedly among the richest** in recent decades.

## 5. Administrative Feasibility and Implementation Steps

Implementing a new wealth tax in the UK is an ambitious undertaking, but it is administratively feasible with careful planning and phasing. Key steps and considerations for rollout include:

1. **Legislative Design and Consultation:** Drafting comprehensive legislation establishing the wealth tax, its definitions, valuation rules, rates, and avoidance provisions. This process would involve consultation with experts (e.g. tax law professionals, economists, HMRC officials) and potentially a public consultation Green Paper. Given the complexity, it may take a year or more to refine the legal framework. Clarity in law is crucial to withstand legal challenges and close loopholes from the outset.

2. **Pilot Valuation Exercise:** In the lead-up to implementation, HMRC (in cooperation with the Office for National Statistics and Valuation Office Agency) could conduct a **pilot wealth assessment** on a sample of high-net-worth individuals (voluntarily or using available data) to test valuation methodologies. This dry run would identify practical issues – for instance, difficulties in appraising private businesses or illiquid assets – and inform the development of guidance and dispute resolution mechanisms. It would also help estimate the distribution of wealth more accurately for final calibration of thresholds or rates.

3. **Capacity Building at HMRC:** Substantial investment in administrative capacity is required. HMRC would **set up a dedicated Wealth Tax division** (as mentioned in Section 3’s enforcement unit) and hire or train personnel with skills in valuation and auditing complex asset holdings. New IT systems would be developed to handle wealth tax returns and cross-check third-party data. These preparations should begin well before the first tax year of enforcement. International experience suggests that **introducing a new tax affecting many individuals could take 2–4 years of preparation**. The Institute for Government has noted that to *“rigorously consider the options, build public support and effectively legislate for and implement a new net wealth tax”* could take over four years. An accelerated timeline is possible, but a rushed implementation risks administrative chaos or loopholes, so a careful approach is advised.

4. **Public Communication and Guidance:** The government must engage in a **strong communication campaign** to explain the wealth tax’s purpose, scope, and the practical process to those affected. Well before the first valuation date, clear guidance and valuation templates should be provided to taxpayers. This will include how to value different asset classes (with HMRC providing lookup tables or online tools for common assets like properties), how to report, and options for payment (including deferral provisions). Given that some affected individuals may not consider themselves “wealthy” (for example, small business owners or those with valuable homes in high-cost areas), messaging should emphasize the high threshold and the measures to address liquidity concerns.

5. **Valuation Mechanisms:** On implementation, a *valuation infrastructure* will be in place. For real estate, the VOA can provide annual updated valuations (similar to how council tax revaluations or business rates revaluations are done, but on a more frequent basis). Taxpayers would be allowed to use professional appraisals for assets like businesses or art, subject to HMRC review. Disputes can be handled by a specialized tribunal if necessary. A pragmatic approach might use **self-assessment with audit**: taxpayers self-report values, but HMRC can challenge and adjust valuations that seem inconsistent with market indicators. Over time, building a database of asset transactions and values will improve accuracy.

6. **Payment and Liquidity Provisions:** The tax would be due annually (perhaps payable alongside Self Assessment tax deadlines). However, to ensure feasibility for those with illiquid asset holdings, **deferred payment options** are built in. For example:

   * *Deferral for Illiquid Assets:* Taxpayers whose wealth is mostly tied in a primary home or a business could elect to defer payment of the portion of tax attributable to those illiquid assets until the asset is sold or transferred. Interest (at a government borrowing rate or a modest premium) would accrue on deferred amounts to compensate the Exchequer. A lien could be placed on the property to secure the tax liability. This is analogous to how inheritance tax can be deferred for certain assets or how some countries allow elderly homeowners to defer property taxes.
   * *Pension Wealth Already Excluded:* Since pension assets are excluded from the base, the major liquidity issue of taxing inaccessible pension funds is avoided (the Wealth Tax Commission had proposed complex mechanisms to defer pension-related charges, which we render unnecessary).
   * *Installment Plans:* By default, the annual tax could be paid in installments through the year (similar to self-assessment payments on account) to spread the burden. If an extraordinary circumstance makes immediate payment difficult, HMRC could agree to a **time-to-pay arrangement**, as it does for other taxes, to avoid distress sales of assets.

   These measures ensure that *no taxpayer is forced into hardship or fire-sales* of assets due to the wealth tax. The deferrals would be relatively rare given the high threshold (most truly wealthy individuals have diversified portfolios and some liquidity), but it provides a safety valve.

7. **Phase-In or One-Off Precursor (Optional):** The government might consider phasing in the tax. For example, an initial **one-off wealth tax** (as recommended by the Wealth Tax Commission) could be levied to test the waters – say 1% on wealth above the threshold, payable over five years. This one-off levy would immediately raise revenue and familiarize both taxpayers and HMRC with valuation processes. After this, the permanent annual tax would commence. Alternatively, the annual tax could start at a lower rate in the first year (e.g. 0.5%/1% instead of 1%/2%) and then rise to full rates once systems are running smoothly. A phased approach can build confidence and allow adjustment before full implementation.

8. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Once in effect, the policy should be continuously monitored. Key metrics include actual revenue vs forecasts, compliance rates, administrative costs, and any signs of unintended consequences (like capital flight or impacts on particular sectors). An independent review commission (possibly the Office for Budget Responsibility or a new Wealth Tax Oversight Board) should publish annual reports on the tax’s performance. After perhaps 5 years, a comprehensive evaluation can be done to decide if any redesign is needed (for instance, tweaking rates, thresholds, or including/excluding certain assets if the outcomes differ from expectations). This feedback loop ensures the wealth tax remains effective and fair as economic conditions evolve.

**Feasibility Outlook:** While setting up a wealth tax is unquestionably complex – no such tax has existed in the UK in modern times – it is administratively achievable. HMRC has demonstrated capacity to implement large-scale tax changes when properly resourced (for example, delivering *PAYE real-time reporting and Making Tax Digital* reforms). Internationally, countries like **Switzerland successfully administer annual wealth taxes** at the canton level, indicating that robust systems can handle the task (Switzerland’s wealth taxes raise about **1.1% of GDP** in revenue). The UK can draw on best practices from those systems. The multi-year lead time recommended is a crucial aspect of feasibility: by legislating the tax well in advance and investing in the necessary administrative framework, the government can ensure a smooth implementation when the tax finally comes into force.

In summary, **with careful planning, adequate resourcing, and stakeholder engagement, the proposed wealth tax is administratively feasible**. The implementation timeline might span several years, but each step – from legislation to valuation to collection – can be managed with existing institutions (augmented as needed). The end result would be a durable new component of the UK tax system, akin in status to income tax or inheritance tax, but squarely aimed at the modern challenges of wealth inequality and fiscal sustainability.

## 6. Economic and Social Impacts

**Impact on Inequality:** The primary rationale for a wealth tax is to **reduce extreme concentrations of wealth and promote a more equitable distribution**. By design, the tax will **extract additional resources from the very richest segment** of society and make it available for public purposes. This has a direct redistributive effect: if implemented, the net wealth of the top 1% will grow more slowly (or even shrink in relative terms) than it otherwise would, narrowing the gap between the top and everyone else. The UK’s wealth inequality is currently high – as noted, the top 1% hold more wealth than the bottom 70%. A moderate annual wealth tax will start to counteract this imbalance. While the immediate effect on the *Gini coefficient* of wealth may be modest (given that a 1–2% yearly tax is relatively small compared to the stock of wealth), over a decade the cumulative effect can be significant, especially if revenues are invested in social programs benefiting lower-wealth groups. Moreover, by taxing large inherited fortunes and concentrated asset holdings, the wealth tax complements existing inheritance tax and capital gains tax in curbing the perpetuation of dynastic wealth. This helps refresh the meritocratic nature of the economy – success and wealth accumulation are still rewarded, but a portion is continually recycled for societal benefit.

**Funding Public Services and Social Mobility:** The tens of billions in revenue could be deployed to improve public services, from education to healthcare. If, for example, wealth tax proceeds are used to fund universal early childhood education or affordable housing, it would further level the playing field (indirectly reducing inequality of opportunity). Such investments can have high social returns. Additionally, dedicating some revenue to poverty reduction programs or to boosting lower-income household assets (through matched savings schemes, etc.) would directly reduce the wealth gap. In essence, the policy can be seen as **transferring some resources from the richest 1% to the collective pot, where it can either be redistributed or used for common goods**. This should ameliorate the public’s sense of unfairness in the current tax system (where often wage earners may feel they are taxed more heavily than asset owners). It is worth noting that public support for taxing extreme wealth is high precisely because people perceive it as increasing fairness.

**Behavioural Responses and Economic Efficiency:** Critics of wealth taxes often argue that they can **discourage savings and investment, or prompt capital flight**. These concerns are important to address:

* *Savings and Investment:* A wealth tax does impose a cost on holding wealth, equivalent to requiring a minimum return to “break even” (e.g. a 1% tax means an asset must earn at least 1% annually to grow). In theory, this could reduce the incentive to save. However, the high threshold means it will affect primarily those who have *already accumulated great wealth*, rather than those in the process of saving to attain wealth. For the ultra-wealthy, empirical evidence suggests their consumption vs. saving decisions are not very sensitive to small changes in net wealth – they tend to save large portions of their income regardless. The tax may encourage the wealthy to seek higher returns on their investments (to cover the tax), which could actually stimulate productive investment. If someone was holding assets purely for capital appreciation or low-yield safety, they might reallocate towards higher-yield ventures (e.g. investing in a business) to offset the wealth tax outflow. In that sense, the tax could *nudge idle capital into more active use*. The impact on the broader economy’s savings rate is likely negligible, given the tiny fraction of population affected. National saving is more influenced by middle-class behavior (pensions, ISAs, etc., which are untouched by this tax).
* *Entrepreneurship:* Some wealthy individuals might be business owners. There is a concern that taxing their shares could reduce their incentive to expand operations or invest. However, the rates proposed are low, and business assets can often generate returns above 1–2%. Additionally, because the tax is proportional to net worth, entrepreneurs still keep the vast majority of any gains they create. The proposal also allows deferred payment for business owners facing liquidity issues, reducing pressure to divert funds from business needs. Countries like Norway have an annual wealth tax but continue to have high levels of entrepreneurship and investment, suggesting such a tax is compatible with a healthy business climate when rates are modest and predictable.
* *Capital Flight and Emigration:* Perhaps the biggest economic concern is that some high-net-worth individuals may **relocate to avoid the tax**, or move their money abroad. This was cited historically when wealth taxes were repealed in Europe. The UK must be mindful of competitiveness. However, several points mitigate this risk: (1) The UK offers many non-tax advantages (business environment, legal system, quality of life) that wealthy individuals value; a moderate wealth tax is unlikely to trigger a mass exodus if the overall package of living in the UK remains attractive. (2) Our design targets mainly *ultra-rich global millionaires and billionaires* – this group does have mobility, but they are also currently under similar pressures elsewhere (for instance, wealth taxes still exist in Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and discussions of wealth taxes are happening in the US and EU). If anything, a coordinated international trend toward taxing wealth would limit safe havens. (3) We include anti-avoidance measures (like the exit charge and treating non-doms as residents after a short period) to raise the cost of leaving purely for tax reasons. We may see a few very wealthy individuals depart, but the impact on the overall economy or tax base would be minor given their small numbers. Meanwhile, those who stay will be contributing more fairly. In the long run, retaining slightly less “magnetism” for footloose billionaires is arguably a reasonable trade-off for greater equity among the resident population.

**Effect on Existing Tax System:** A wealth tax also interacts with other taxes on wealth. Ideally, over time, the government could consider **rationalizing the broader wealth taxation landscape**. For example, if a net wealth tax is raising substantial revenue, it might allow for adjustments to *inheritance tax (IHT)* or *capital gains tax (CGT)* to avoid double-taxation in some areas. Our proposal doesn’t assume immediate changes to those taxes, but it notes that the overall tax burden on capital should be monitored. In some cases, wealth tax could fill gaps that other taxes miss (for instance, CGT is only on realized gains and has many exemptions; IHT can be avoided through planning or only hits at death). A moderate annual wealth tax ensures an ongoing contribution from large fortunes that might otherwise pass lightly taxed between generations. **Efficiency-wise**, a broad-based wealth tax with few exemptions is less distortionary than highly specific wealth taxes or transaction taxes. By excluding pensions (already taxed via income tax on payouts) and not touching normal consumption, it avoids overlap. There could even be **dynamic benefits**: if revenue from the wealth tax is used to lower taxes that distort work effort (such as very high marginal income tax rates on labor) or to reduce government borrowing, it might improve economic efficiency overall.

**Social and Political Implications:** Implementing a wealth tax would send a strong signal that **the UK is committed to tackling inequality and asking everyone to contribute their fair share** in rebuilding the economy. This could bolster social cohesion if presented and perceived as a matter of justice. The fact that the public supports such measures means it could enhance trust in government – showing that policymakers are responsive to concerns about fairness. On the other hand, it is likely to face opposition from those affected (wealthy individuals may lobby against it or use media influence). The government will need to make a clear, evidence-based case that this tax is **both fair and necessary** for the greater good. If implemented well, over time the wealth tax could become a normal part of the fiscal system (much as progressive income tax did in the 20th century), and its initial controversy may wane. The key is demonstrating that it is **working as intended – raising revenue from those most able to pay, without damaging the economy**.

It is also worth noting the **horizontal equity achieved**: by taxing net wealth comprehensively (aside from pensions), the tax reduces existing distortions where, for example, someone investing in property might face different tax treatment than someone holding financial assets. Under this plan, *all asset types owned by a very wealthy person are treated uniformly*, so there is less incentive to funnel wealth into a particular tax-favored asset (aside from pensions, which remain an encouraged form of saving). This can lead to a more balanced allocation of capital in the economy over time, guided by economic fundamentals rather than tax avoidance motives.

**Summary of Impacts:** In sum, the economic and social impacts of the proposed wealth tax are **largely positive in terms of equity and revenue, and manageable in terms of efficiency costs**. It will modestly temper the accumulation of wealth at the very top, generate substantial funds for public use, and signal a shift towards a more inclusive economy. Potential negatives like avoidance and capital flight are addressed through policy design, and the remaining risk is judged to be outweighed by the benefits to social justice and fiscal sustainability. By concentrating the tax on non-pension assets of the ultra-wealthy, the policy minimizes any hardship or behavioral distortion on the majority of citizens, focusing its reach where the societal gains from redistribution are highest.

## Conclusion

This policy proposal has outlined a detailed framework for a **UK net wealth tax targeting assets and investments above £2 million, excluding pensions**. The proposal specifies clear thresholds and low rates that ensure only the wealthiest pay significant amounts, a broad base of assets to prevent erosion of the tax, and robust enforcement mechanisms to make the tax effective. Conservative revenue estimates suggest around **£20 billion or more could be raised annually**, offering a new avenue to fund public priorities or reduce deficits. Administrative challenges are real but surmountable with proper lead time and resources – international examples and the UK’s own institutional strength provide confidence that such a tax can be implemented successfully.

Ultimately, this wealth tax is aimed at **addressing the pressing issue of inequality in the UK**. Over the past decades, asset prices and fortunes have surged for a minority, even as fiscal pressures strain public services. A carefully crafted wealth tax asks for a greater contribution from those who have benefited the most, in order to invest in the common good and rebalance opportunities. Importantly, by **excluding pension savings**, the proposal respects the social contract around retirement and focuses on discretionary wealth. It is a realistic compromise that prioritizes political feasibility and fairness – the segments of wealth that the public views as most fair to tax (financial investments, additional properties, etc.) are included, while those seen as rightfully earned for personal security (pensions, main home up to a high threshold) are shielded.

If enacted, this policy would mark a significant but justified shift in the UK’s tax system. It aligns with a broader international conversation about taxing wealth in the 21st century’s economy. By legislating a well-designed wealth tax, the UK can become a leader in equitable tax policy, demonstrating that it is possible to curb inequality **without stifling economic vitality**. The proposal seeks to strike that balance. It is **realistic, evidence-based, and attuned to the UK context**, drawing on expert recommendations and public attitudes alike. The social contract underpinning taxation would be strengthened: all citizens, including the most affluent, play a part in funding the society from which they benefit.

In conclusion, this UK wealth tax on non-pension assets represents a bold yet pragmatic tool to foster a fairer economy. With careful implementation, it can achieve substantial revenue and inequality reduction, **while upholding the principles of fairness and efficiency** in the tax system. The time is ripe for such a policy, and the evidence suggests it can succeed in making Britain not only a prosperous nation, but a more just one.
